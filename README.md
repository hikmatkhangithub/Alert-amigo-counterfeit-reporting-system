# Counterfeit Reporting System Based on Blockchain Technology

This project was developed as a result of our research project under the professorship of distributed and self-organizing systems. The purpose of this research project was to developed a user-friendly counterfeit reporting system based on blockchain technology, to report fake and hazardous products to the European Union authoroties and then take furthur actions.
